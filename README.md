## 🚀 What’s This Project About?  
This is a fun personal project where I dug into Washington State’s electric vehicle (EV) data — but with a twist: I only focused on **Teslas**. I’ve been a Tesla fan for as long as I can remember (it’s my dream car!), so I thought, why not combine that with my love for data?  

Using **R**, I cleaned up the dataset, crunched some numbers, and made a bunch of visuals to answer questions from a “Tesla Executive Briefing” style outline. Basically, it’s a mix of curiosity, data skills, and a bit of fanboy energy.  

## 🔍 The Questions I Answered  
- What share of EVs in Washington are Teslas?  
- Which Tesla models are the most popular, and how much do they bring in?  
- How do Tesla’s range and price stack up against other brands?  
- How are PHEVs (Plug-in Hybrids) vs BEVs (Battery EVs) trending?  
- Which electric utilities do Tesla owners use the most?  

## 🛠 Tools I Used  
- **R** for all the analysis and charts  
- **tidyverse**, **ggplot2**, **dplyr** for data wrangling and visuals  
- Washington State EV registration data (filtered for Teslas)  
- Final report made with **R Markdown** → HTML  

## 📊 Highlights  
- Teslas take up a big slice of the EV market in Washington  
- Model 3 and Model Y are the heavy hitters  
- Tesla’s range is often longer than competitors at similar or lower MSRPs  
- BEVs are growing faster than PHEVs  
- A few utilities dominate Tesla charging support in the state
